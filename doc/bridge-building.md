# How to Make a Bridge

A Bridge is dedicated to the free distribution of knowledge, often through in-person events, where people teach others a specific technology.  RailsBridge, ClojureBridge and MobileBridge are examples of Bridges.  Each Bridge has chapters in different geographic regions, or individual workshops are held wherever people are inspired to help.

The bridge is not only between experts and learners, but also designed as a way to reach out to people underrepresented in our community.  Allies are welcome as teachers and TAs. We offer training sessions not only about the curriculum, but also teach volunteers effective teaching techniques and how to create a safe space.

### 1) Get in Touch

* Send email to hello@bridgefoundry.org
* Meet with Sarah Allen to discuss your understanding of the mission
* Make sure that there are people on the founding team who increase diversity in tech
* Review our [code of conduct](http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/), make sure you have someone comfortable handling situations that may arise (or someone willing to learn how)

### 2) Get Connected

* Slack: https://bridge-things.slack.com  (Sarah or another Bridge leader can invite you)
* Google Group:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bridgefoundry

### 3) Get Started

* Figure out your approach: it's ok to borrow from other Bridges or do something new
* Open communication: best practices / common patterns
  * Organizing with github issues forked from: https://github.com/mobilebridge/organizing
  * Google Group or other open forum
  * Encouraging additional teachers/volunteers
  * Hold a volunteer meeting
  * Make a list of things you would like volunteers to help with
  * Announce your effort on the Bridge Foundry google group, create a slack channel
* Plan your first activity, for example:
  * Teacher training and a first workshop (check out the [WorkshopCookbook](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/WorkshopCookbook/wiki))
  * Online documentation efforts
  * Open source coding
  * Your special event
* Blog about it, Do it again

### 4) Make it Sustainable

  * Learn, adapt, iterate
  * Help others replicate your success, allow for their own interpretations / innovations
  * Figure out how to replace yourself
