# How to Make a Bridge

### 1) send email to hello@bridgefoundry.org

* Meet with Sarah to discuss your understanding of the mission
* make sure that there are people on the founding team who increase diversity in tech
* review code of conduct, make sure you have someone comfortable handling stuff that happens (or someone willing to learn how)

### 2) Get Started

* figure out what to teach
* best practices / common patterns
  * organizing with github issues for workshops, forked from: https://github.com/mobilebridge/organizing
  * Google Group or other open forum
  * encouraging new teachers
  * have a volunteer meeting
  * teacher training
  * hold your first workshop!
  * blog about it, do it again

### 3) Make it sustainable

  * learn, adapt, iterate
  * help others replicate your success, allow for their own interpretations / innovations
  * figure out how to replace yourself
